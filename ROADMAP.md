# Roadmap

This project is intentionally starting small.

The goal is to explore what a focused, accessibility-first job board for
nonprofit and humanitarian organizations could look like — without rushing
into complexity.

## Phase 1 — Exploration (current)
- Static HTML/CSS prototype
- Accessibility-aware structure and styling
- Job card layout and basic filters (UI only)
- Community feedback and validation

## Phase 2 — Light iteration (possible)
- Refine role categories and org taxonomy
- Improve accessibility patterns based on feedback
- Clarify scope and boundaries
- Optional: JSON-based data source for jobs

## Phase 3 — To be determined
Future steps (if any) will depend on:
- Community interest
- Sustainability considerations
- Clear, demonstrated need

This roadmap is intentionally flexible.
Staying small and useful is a valid outcome.
